My first data analysis project

Question: Which Formula 1 races had the highest rate of attrition? (And were obviously therefore the most interesting to watch)

Data: http://ergast.com/mrd/ (althought I used a different source that hadn't been fully updated for the 2023 season)

The story so far: 
Carried out EDA in SQL Server
Wrote SQL query to return Retirements Per Lap
Visualised data in PowerBI
